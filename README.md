# godot_template
Godot-based template to start a simple game

Very simple could be useful for a small project or game jam.
Features:

* Splash Screen with fade-in, fade-out
* Main Menu Scene with: Play, Options, Credits and Exit buttons
* Play button does nothing (it is a template so you should provide that!)
* Autoload script for scene managemnet (taking from online tutorials, thanks!)
* Cross-menu music (autoload scene)
* Options File based on ConfigFile class (saves music and soundfx options, can be etended of course)
* Exit signal capture (displays exit dialog on main menu, goes back to main menu on other screens)
